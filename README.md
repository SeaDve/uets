# Universal Entity Tracking System

UETS is a universal system that tracks entities using RFID tags. It is designed to be used in a variety of applications, such as inventory management, establishment access control, and more.

## ✨ Features

### Report Generation

- Filter by date range, entity ID, name, location, etc.
- Visualize data in a graph.
- Export as PDF or XLSX via QR code.

### Real-time Monitoring

- View entities entering and exiting in real-time.
- View real time statistics and graphs.

### Easy Data Handling

- Pre-input data via spreadsheet files.
- Support for BPSU CEA's QRifying system and national ID QR codes.

## 🕹️ Operation Modes

### Counter

This is used for entities that don't have any specific data (e.g., mall entry counter).

### Attendance

This is used for tracking attendance, whereas unauthorized entities are not allowed to enter (e.g., classroom, meeting room, school gate, establishment entry).

### Parking

This is used for tracking parking spaces and vehicles (e.g., parking lot).

This is useful for tracking how long a vehicle has been parked and whether it is authorized to park.

### Inventory

This is used for entities that have lifetime, location, and quantity (e.g., stock room, department store, medicine storage).

### Refrigerator

This is used for entities that have lifetime and quantity (e.g., food storage).

This is experimental as it is labor-intensive to tag entities with this kind.
